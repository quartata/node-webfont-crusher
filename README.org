Get just the glyphs your site needs from a font.

Example use case:

You have: a TTF, OTF, EOT, SVG, WOFF OR WOFF2 font.

You want: a tiny subset of the glyphs.

For example, Font Awesome is awesome, but it's huge:

#+begin_example
$ du -h ./*
108K	FontAwesome.otf
72K	fontawesome-webfont.eot
360K	fontawesome-webfont.svg
140K	fontawesome-webfont.ttf
84K	fontawesome-webfont.woff
68K	fontawesome-webfont.woff2
#+end_example

That's a big download if you just want one or two glyphs.

All you need to know is the unicode codepoints of the glyphs you want to keep,
everything else will be discarded.

There are a bunch of web services that can do this for you, but I wanted
something more programmatic.
